This script processes clinical data, calculates statistical metrics, selects specific data points based on calculated mean values, and visualizes the results using Seaborn scatter plots.performs K-Means clustering on selected animal distance files. It generates PNG and PDF files for scaterplot and pdf file for K-Mean clustering.

#Input Files

clinical_data.txt: This file contains clinical data used for statistical calculations.

Diversity Scores (./inputfiles/diversityScores/): Directory containing .diversity.txt files for different animals.

Distance Files (./inputfiles/distanceFiles/): Directory containing .distance.txt files used for plotting.

#Output Files

clinical_data.stats.txt: Contains the original clinical data with additional calculated columns (Mean_value and STD_value).

Scatter Plots: Each selected animal has two plot files generated:

{animal}.png

{animal}.pdf

Elbow and K_mean plot generate two pdf files :

{animal}_elbow.pdf
{animal}_clustered.pdf


#Runing Script
