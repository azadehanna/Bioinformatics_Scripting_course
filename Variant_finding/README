##Author: Azadeh Nikouee

There are two python scripts for this assignment including:
1-pipeline.py
2-report.py


1-pipeline.py

 This pipeline has 3 steps:

1-Demultiplexing,
2-Alignment
3-Variant Discovery 
       This pipeline processes a pooled FASTQ file (hawkins_pooled_sequences.fastq) by:
•	Demultiplexing reads based on sample-specific barcodes (provided in harrington_clinical_data.txt)
•	Aligning the demultiplexed reads to a reference genome (dgorgon_reference.fa )
•	Performing variant discovery via a pileup analysis
Dependencies
•	Python 3.x
•	Python modules: os, gzip, subprocess, pysam
•	BWA for indexing and alignment
•	SAMtools for converting, sorting, and indexing alignment files

Input files:
harrington_clinical_data.txt   
 hawkins_pooled_sequences.fastq 
 dgorgon_reference.fa

output files:
A folder called fastqs that contains the demultiplexed fastqs for each sample.
A folder called bams that contains the sorted.bam (and .bai files) file for each sample.
A folder called variant_results that contains variant analysis output for each sample.


Command line to run pipeline script:
python3 pipeline.py

2-report.py

This script processes variant discovery results and clinical data to generate a summary report for each sample. For each sample, it reports whether a mutation was detected, and if so, provides details on the position, read coverage, mutated base, and the frequency of that mutation.


Dependencies
Python 3.x
Python Packages: pandas 
Built-in modules: os, csv, ast

Inputs:
1-harrington_clinical_data.txt
2-Process variant files in  variant results  directory

Outputs:
report.txt


command line to generate report:
python3 report.py
