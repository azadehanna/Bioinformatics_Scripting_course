The goal of this script is to  identify and counte specific DNA motifs within the bacterial genome of R. bifella. 


The bash script “week_2_assign.sh” needs two input files including:
 1-interesting_motifs.txt: Contains a list of motifs to search for.
 2-r_bifella.fasta: The genome sequence file in FASTA format.

Execute the following command to run the bash script "week_2_assign.sh":
./week_2_assign.sh

The outputs of this script after run:
 There are two outputs:
 1-motif_count.txt is a text file contains the number of motif occurrences in the bacterial genome
 2-motifs directory that contains FASTA file for each motif(motif.fast) that includes  all of the genes and their corresponding sequences that have that motif
